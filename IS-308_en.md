# Contents
Since 1968, when the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was established, there have been no significant changes to the specifications behind all traffic on the Internet. But the development of microprocessor technology has opened up possibilities for a rich ecosystem of architectures. These architectures have a great impact on many social processes. The focus of this subject is on these architectures and their applications. Key words include microservices, big data, cloud computing, IoT (Internet of Things), UXD (User eXperience Design), CI / CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment), and many programming languages ​​and development environments for these. .

# Teaching and learning methods
The main work method is project-based learning in connection with a student-defined or an external project (must be relevant to the topic).
Theoretical aspects of distributed systems and Internet technologies are introduced and discussed at weekly seminars. The seminars are related to the practical projects the students work with. Form of work is team-based learning.
Functions in the Canvas web application are used to stimulate both individual and team-based learning.
There is compulsory attendance up to 4 hours a week, which includes joint gatherings and teamwork.
Expected work volume is 10 hours per week.

# Exam
Portfolio assessment. An overall grade is given for all the work in the folder. The work includes, among other things, learning logs, reviews of productions from various media, as well as project report and source code. Details of the contents of the folder and the weighting of the various artifacts are given during the semester.

# Student evaluation
The study program leader, in consultation with the student union representative, determines the form of evaluation and whether the courses should have mid-term or final evaluation, cf. the quality system chapter 4.1. Information about the evaluation form for the topic is published in Canvas.
