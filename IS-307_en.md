Students must have passed 90 credits. In special cases, students with fewer completed credits can take the course according to agreement with the Department of Information Systems. Otherwise, the student's individual competence is assessed based on the host organization's needs and specific requirements for competence in order to be able to solve special tasks, and in accordance with an agreement between the organization and the Department of Information Systems.

# Learning outcome
After completing the course (project in an organization) the student will:
* have gained practical skills and experiences in innovation with IT, IT operations and / or system development
* have gained a broad understanding of what is expected of knowledge and practical skills in a job situation

# Contents
The purpose is to give the student insight into and understanding of a specific organization's needs and processes related to an IT-related project. Current projects are often linked to innovation with ICT, system development or procurement, operation and maintenance of various types of IT and information systems. The projects can be carried out in organizations in the public or private sector. It is possible to carry out projects in the voluntary sector.

By working for a long time with a concrete task in an organization, the student should gain insight into practical problem solving in a job situation.

The content of the course is determined by the organisation's needs and according to the agreement entered into between the organization and the Department of Information Systems. The content of the project must be academically relevant to the specialization directions of the bachelor program in IT and information systems. Examples of current tasks may be
* various activities within innovation and system development including preparation of business plan
* business case
* preparation of requirement specification
* analysis and design
* programming tasks
* installation, operation and maintenance of systems, databases, networks and the like

# Teaching and learning methods
It is planned that the student is placed in an organization 1 day a week throughout the semester. The projects are individual. In special cases - if the project allows this - 2 students can work together. This must be clarified with the course coordinator in advance, and will require a larger scope of the project.

The Department of Information Systems does not guarantee internships. The students themselves are responsible for finding an organization to work in and preparing a contract between the client, the student himself and the Department of Information Systems. A contract template will be available through UiA's publication channels. If the Department of Information Systems receives requests from companies about relevant candidates, this will be communicated through relevant channels. It is important to look for a internship well in advance of the start of the course (preferably 1-2 months in advance).

There is limited organized teaching in the course. 4-5 compulsory gatherings will be arranged, with an emphasis on exchanging experiences between the students, and individual guidance will be offered. In the last collection, the students present their projects to clients and other interested parties.

The standard workload for 7.5 credits is 10 hours per week.
